<p>My name is Strahinja.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a third year Computer Engineering student at the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade.</p>
<p>I started programming at the age of 14 when I developed my first Minecraft plugin, which became my passion that I kept pursuing all the way through high school. This passion for programming Minecraft plugins helped me become proficient in the Java programming language. At that time I got interested in backend web development, which led me to learn about NodeJS, databases and Typescript.</p>
<p>After I had been sharpening my Minecraft plugin programming skills for 3-4 years, I started working as a freelance Minecraft plugin developer, and worked through the latter years of high school. I wrote code that was responsible for interfacing with PostgreSQL for storing player data, and RabbitMQ for passing messages between server and proxy instances. I also learned how to use Git and build systems like Gradle.</p>
<p>In the year 2021, I enrolled at the University of Belgrade. During my first and second year of university I found my passion for low-level programming and hardware. I am currently working very hard on learning about operating systems, computer architecture and oragnization, as well as digital design.</p>
